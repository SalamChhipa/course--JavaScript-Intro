</head>
<body>
    filter array method is use to extract elements from parent array <br>
    and add them in another array <br>
    extraction is done by defining a function in which <br>
    we use certain statement or condition to filter <br>
    array1 = [1,3,4,5,6,8,23,45,56,76]; <br>
    now lets make another array in which we extract elements that <br>
    are divided by 2 from array1 <br>
